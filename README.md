# Hello GitHub

This is just a useless HelloWorld project intended for me to get familiar with git and GitHub. And also Markdown, it seems.

I might as well use this repo as a presentation of me and what I will be doing here. So, up til now I have been versioning all my projects on a Debian NAS server at home, using SVN. This is fine, however I feel the amount of "small" experimental projects is growing and so I thought i'd be a good idea to explore git and GitHub for those types of projects and keep the "bigger" projects to myself on my SVN server.

[CodePen](http://codepen.io/ "CodePen") is also one of those things that I would like to explore, but I just don't have the energy to be at all places at once. [My CodePen profile](http://codepen.io/chromawoods/ "My CodePen profile") is rather thin ATM. :) Perhaps I'll publish my stuff here on GH and then use them to demo stuff on CodePen. We'll see.

## Trying out some code snippets

### JavaScript

I love JS. It's such a fun language. The more I explore it, the more I like it.

```javascript
var helloGitHub = function (l) {
    var msg = 'There will be quite a lot of ' + l + ' here, oh yes.';
    return msg;
};

console.log(helloGitHub('JavaScript'));
```

### PHP

PHP used to be my primary language, but recently I haven't spent so much time on it since I have immersed myself in JS instead.

```php
function helloGitHub($l) {
    $msg = 'And probably some ' . $l . ' too.';
    return $msg;
}

echo helloGitHub('PHP');
```

### HTML

Well, HTML just comes with the package of being productive on the interwebz, doesn't it? It's becoming so much more meaningful now that we can use HTML5. Exciting times, man.

```html
<section>
    <p class="msg">And of course the ol' HTML markup.</p>
</section>
```

CSS is also fun. It's all moving very fast now and it's mostly exciting and good. Mostly.

### CSS

```css
.msg {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    background: url('we_need/stylesheets/with_that.png') 0 0 no-repeat transparent;
}
.msg:after { content: "That is all for now."; }
```
